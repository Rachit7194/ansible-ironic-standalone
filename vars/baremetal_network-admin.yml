# Netwok definitions for admin vlan
# Each network can have two definitions depending on if 'baremetal_ip',
# is defined. Only the first variable is required, you can omit the 
# dhcp version in order to fail if the user did not provide an IP.
# Use those 2 variables for definitons:

baremetal_network_list:
  - device: "eth0.507"
    type: "vlan"
    bootproto: "dhcp"
    backend: ["eth0"]
  - device: "eth0.500"
    type: "vlan"
    backend: ["eth0"]  
    address: "{{ baremetal_ip }}"
    netmask: "255.255.255.0"
    gateway: "10.230.0.1"
    nameservers: "{{ baremetal_nameservers }}"
    domain: "{{ baremetal_domain }}"

# Same case without IP (with DHCP).
# Optional variable.
baremetal_network_dhcp_list:
  - device: "eth0.507"
    type: "vlan"
    bootproto: "dhcp"
    backend: ["eth0"]
  - device: "eth0.500"
    type: "vlan"
    bootproto: "dhcp"
    backend: ["eth0"]  
    nameservers: "{{ baremetal_nameservers }}"
    domain: "{{ baremetal_domain }}"
