# Rules to apply when a new node is discovered
# http://docs.openstack.org/developer/ironic-inspector/http-api.html
# https://github.com/openstack/ironic-inspector/blob/master/doc/source/usage.rst

# NOTE: If you change a rule but not its name, it wont be applied
# because the Ansible task only checks if it exists by name, not by
# the content. You can delete all the rules before running ansible with
# curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5050/v1/rules
# or fill the UUID of the rules in the variable defined at the bottom of this
# file. The intention behind this file is define your custom rules
# You can check the rules defined with curl -X GET http://localhost:5050/v1/rules

# This rules will be applied even if not automatic enrollment (default PXE boot)
# is enabled. The rest of discovery_rules will be applied only when
# ironic_inspector_discovery_enroll is True

# Define your additional discovery rules
